\section{Introduction}
An Mp3 Player is a device that has only one purpose, which is to play Mp3 files or songs. It can sometimes include a Display to let you know which song is being played, and what the next songs are.\\

8 Bit Music got its name from Music generated from \textit{PSG(programmable Sound
Generator)} Chip, located usually on 8-bit Microprocessors as opposed to Modern 64 Bit ones. It uses limited Frequencies to create any sound or tune.\\

In This project we will use \textbf{Arduino UNO} which uses an \textbf{ATMega328} chipset, which is an \textit{8 Bit processor} combined with an LCD Screen to make a very simple Music Player.

\section{Circuit Explanation and Working}

\subsection{Power}	
Power to the Arduino is given from a standard Li-Ion 3.7V Battery or a 5V Battery or Wall Adapter that outputs 5V 2A.
Power to the LCD Screen and the Buzzer is then supplied from the Arduino.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.25]{arduino.jpg}
	\caption{Power To the Arduino}
	\label{fig:Arduion pic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Inputs}
Inputs are taken from The Main switch, that controls the Entire working, and push buttons that control the playback. The Volume of the buzzer is controlled by a Potentiometer that simply increases the resistance, and thereby reducing the current passing in the Buzzer, resulting in control of sound. \\

Another Potentiometer controls the Brightness of the LCD Screen in the same way.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.8]{push_buttons.jpg}
	\caption{Inputs from Buttons are given to Digital PINS of the Arduino}
	\label{fig:button pic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Processing}

All of the Processing is done with the Arduino, and the ATMEGA8U2 Chip inside it. If the play button is pressed, it sends a HIGH signal to pin 11 of the Arduino, which is detected, and the Arduino then sends calculated power processed in milliseconds by taking instructions from the code to PIN 8, where the Buzzer is connected. \\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.45]{chipset.jpg}
	\caption{Chip of the Arduino}
	\label{fig:chipset pic}
\end{figure}

Similarly, When buttons are pressed, they send a voltage to another PIN of the Arduino that is detected, and the song is changed accordingly. 

\subsection{Code}
The Complete code is not shown here due to space restrictions, only the main function names are given to get a crude idea.

LiquidCrystal lcd(7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2);

// Declaring Basic Variables and Booleans.
int song = 0, end = 0;
int playing = 0, pause = 1;

// List of Songs

	"Mario Theme",

}

void loop()
{
	// Check if The Main switch is turned on, only then we do anything.
	if (digitalRead(SWITCH_PIN) == 1)
	{
		// Switch on the LED indicating that we have turned on.
		digitalWrite(ON_PIN, HIGH);
		
		// If user presses forward, change song and show it.
		if (digitalRead(FORWARD_PIN) == 1) {}
		
		// If user presses Previous, change song and show it.
		if (digitalRead(PREV_PIN) == 1) {}
		
		// If user presses play, then play the song
		if ((digitalRead(PLAY_PIN) == 1) && (playing == 0) && (pause = 1)) {}
		end = 0;
	}
	
	// If the main switch is off, then turn of the LED and Print Thank You.
	else if ((digitalRead(SWITCH_PIN) == 0) && (end == 0)){}
}

	
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Outputs}
PIN 8 of the Arduino sends Power to the buzzer or alternatively a speaker that will produce the sound at the desired Frequency.

	\caption{The Speaker or Buzzer in User}
	\label{fig:buzzer pic}
\end{figure}

Digital PIN 2 - Digital PIN 7 of the Arduino, along with 5V Power and Ground connects to various inputs of the LCD Screen which then outputs the current song that is being played.

\section{Applications}
\begin{enumerate}
\item An Arduino being far superior than required for a project like this one, would make it impractical to buy and use, but the Chipset, and certain music ICs paired with the same arrangement as in this project can be used to make a good 8-Bit Music Player.
\item The Arduino itself has numerous Applications like: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Weighing Machines.
	\item Traffic Light Count Down Timer.
	\item Parking Lot Counter.
	\item Home Automation.
	\item Industrial Automation.
	\item Medical Instrument.
	\item Emergency Light for Railways.
\end{enumerate}

\item The LCD Screen can also be used to display anything from a clock,
a timer, weights, Temperatures, or any needed value, cheaply and easily.
\item More Songs can be programmed and added to then put this into something very small and
portable for a quick, simple and cheap Music Player.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Improvements}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The Expensive Arduino can be replaced with the
	chipset used inside or another Music IC coupled
	with another cheaper Microprocessor IC to reduce
	the cost (while increasing the complications) of the
	Project.

	\item A Better Buzzer can be used for better sound
	Quality
	
	\item A Program can be written that automatically
	converts any song into its 8 Bit code version so it
	becomes easy to add new songs, instead of hard
	coding them into the Aruduino.
	
	\item An External Storage of some sort can be added like
	an SD Card to store Thousands of other Songs.
	
	\item All The components can be put in a small Enclosing
	for increasing Portabitlity.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Learning Experience}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item I got to interact with the Basic LCD Screen, and so now that can be used in many
	other places, which is an important output device.
	\item Exposure to a Microprocessor and working on such a low level of input and output
	gave a better and more open idea about the working of a computer.
	\item 2 Terminal Switches are basic, but 3 terminal switches with a ground pin make use of
	more Electrical concepts which were put to use by actually using them. This
	also forced me to learn the basics of the Potentiometer and its detailed working.
	\item Programming the Basics of Music also made me learn some Music Theory, reading
	some music notes, and an in depth working of a speaker.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conclusion}
A very simple 8-bit Music Player was made, programmed and Built in
Tinkercad successfully. The Working, Programming, and basic functioning of the Arduino, a
Buzzer, an LCD Screen, Switches and Potentiometer was studied and
Applied in detail.
