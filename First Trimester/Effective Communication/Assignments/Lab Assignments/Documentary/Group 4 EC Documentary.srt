1
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,000
So you have just tuned in, to a rather interesting 
IPL Match

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,000
Just the 5 overs are remaining, and you start 
craving some crispy Pakodas

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So you think to yourself, Mom, Please 
make some Pakodas for me

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But, Obviously Mom says that you have just had lunch
This is not the time for Pakodas

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So you dont have any other choice, 
and you turn to your phone. 

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And you start browsing immediately, 
on swiggy or zomato

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and you start ordering your pakodas
Just a few mins later, and there your doorbell rings

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So have you ever wondered, what is the story behind these
people, and how they delivery these things to you?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How is it that they have come at this young age to become delivery boys

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Today, we decided, All of us walked to the streets of Pune, and meet them ourselves

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you Brother, The first thing that I want to talk to you about
Is since when are you doing this job?

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
3 years

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is it full time or part time?

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Full time

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Does Zomato pay for your daily expenses? or you have to bear them?

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
we have to bear them...

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So how many orders do you complete in a day? 
15-20...

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
How do you get the zomato orders in your phone?

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The server assigns the orders to us

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is there any incident that happened during your tenure?
Maybe during delivery..?

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Nothing as such has happened till today but some people do
COD (Cash on Delivery)

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
then we have to convince them to do COD
or do online payment

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And in Pune city most of the time the delivery 
location is not accurate

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
then the customer has to guide them to the correct 
location and gps is also not always accurate

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Have you faced any problems in these covid times?

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In these difficult times our company zomato had given us special instructions
to where and how to keep the order and we used to leave the order on the table or chair

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
that was kept outside the door and then we used to take the photo and notify
the customer through the app and the customer used to see that the order has arrived 

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and accordingly the customer would come and take the order

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
While you are delivering the order has there been any issue
with the security guard or while picking up the order from the restaurant

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The restaurants delay the order sometimes but we get to know it

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And because of this have ever faced any issue from the customer

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No, as soon as we receive the call of the customer we tell them about
the delay in order and it shows the customer in the app

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:56,000
that the rider has picked up your order from the restaurant, 
and sometimes customer asks them about the order

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:09,000
so they tell them about the order that has been delayed and
 the further situation will be updated on the app 

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Any Problems, issues with the security guards?

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No,not all 

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Any problem you faced with them?

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
no never, we adjust.

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We have our University project regarding the food delivery boys

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So when these delivery boys come, do you indulge in any conversation with them?

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We take his number, we ask his name, where he wants to deliver the food, and thats it.

42
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Have you ever faced any conflicts with them 
No, we dont talk much. They do their work, we do ours

43
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:55,000
First of all thank you for time and having a small talk with us. 
Since when are you working here?

44
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
5 Years

45
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So we asked the delivery boys about their confrontation with you,
they said that food vendors take alot of time to prepare the food.

46
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It takes time to prepare food

47
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They said that even if they arrive late to collect food it is still not ready.

48
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It takes time for us to prepare as there ae many orders. 
If we prepare it in advance it will become cold till it reaches the customer

49
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Does the always happen or you manage it

50
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No we manage it all the time. This doesn't happen often

51
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
When the delivery boys come, is your coversation with them limited to work?

52
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No no limited, we ask them their id and order id, 
if the food is ready we give it, if not we ask them wait

53
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Do you know any of the delivery boys personally?

54
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
no i dont

55
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
There are many delivery boys, its hard to keep track

56
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If there are no orders, how do you pass your time?

57
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I often use social media and surf on the internet
