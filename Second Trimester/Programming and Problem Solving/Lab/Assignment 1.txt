Write algorithm and draw flowchart to Calculate the volume and area of sphere using the formulas V=4* Pi*r3/3 and A=4*pi*r2 
where r is radius of square of the sphere.

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables area = 0, volume = 0, PI = 3.14, radius = 0 as floating point numbers. 
Step 3: Print "Enter Radius of the Sphere"
Step 4: Input the radius of the Sphere
Step 5: Store the value of radius in the variable radius.
Step 6: Calculate the Volume and assign it to variable volume with formula V=4* Pi*r3/3
Step 7: Calculate the Area of the Sphere and assign it to variable area with formula A=4*pi*r2
Step 8: Print "Volume of Sphere is" volume, and "Area of Sphere is" area. 
Step 9: Stop.

Pseudo Code:

int main(){

    float volume = 0, area = 0, radius = 0, PI = 3.14
    print("Enter radius")
    input(radius)
    volume = (4/3) * PI * radius * radius
    area = PI * radius * radius * 4
    print("Volume is", volume, "Area is", area)
}

Write algorithm and draw flowchart to calculate roots of a quadratic equation.

Pseudo Code:

int main(){
    float root_1, root_2, a, b, c, det;
    print("Enter the values of A, B and C")
    input(a, b, c)
    det = sqrt(b*b -(4 * a * c))
    root_1 = (-b + det)/(2 * a)ḍ
    root_1 = (-b - det)/(2 * a)ḍ
    print("The First root is", root_1)
    print("The Second root is", root_2)
}

Algorithm:
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare the Variables root_1, root_2, a, b, c, det = 0 as floats
Step 3: Print "Enter the values of A B C"
Step 4: Input the values of A, B, C and assign them to a, b, c
Step 5: Calculate the Determinant and assign it to det as det = sqrt(b*b -(4 * a * c))
Step 6: Calculate the first root as: root_1 = (-b + det)/(2 * a)d
Step 7: Calculate the second root as: root_1 = (-b - det)/(2 * a)ḍ
Step 8: Print the Values





Write the Algorithm and Flowchart to convert a decimal number into Binary. 

Pseudo Code: 

int main()
{
    int bin = 0, remainder = 0, dec = 0

    printf("Please Enter the Decimal Number")
    input(dec)
    for (int i = 0; dec != 0;i++)
    {
        remainder = dec % 2
        bin += remainder * pow(10, i)
        dec /= 2
    }
    print("The Number in Binary is: %d", bin)
}

Algorithm:
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare the Variables bin, remainder, dec = 0 as integers. 
Step 3: Print "Enter the Decimal Number on the Screen"
Step 4: Input the value Decimal Number from the user. 
Step 5: Find the Remainder when Decimal number is divided by 2 and assign it to remainder variable
Step 6: Multiply Remainder by 10^i(loop variable) and assign it to binary
Step 7: Divide the Decimal Number by 2 and Assign it to itself
Step 8: Repeat until value of Decimal number becomes 0
Step 9: Print the value of the Binary Variable
Step 10: End
